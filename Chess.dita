    <p>Chess is a two-player game that utilizes a <xref href="#Chess/section_chessboard"
        format="dita">chessboard</xref> and sixteen <xref href="#Chess/section_pieces" format="dita"
        >pieces</xref> of six types for each player. See Wikipedia for a basic history of the game
      of chess.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Object of the Game</b>
       To win a chess match, a player must use their chess pieces to create a situation where
            the opponent's king is unable to make a move to avoid capture.

      <title>The Chessboard</title>
      <p>A chessboard consists of 64 square spaces in an 8x8 grid. The squares are arranged in two
        alternating colors (light and dark). Sixteen "light" and sixteen "dark" pieces are placed on
        the board at the beginning of the game. The board is placed so that a white square is in
        each player's near-right corner. Horizontal rows are called <i>ranks</i> and vertical rows
        are called <i>files</i>.</p>

      <title>The Chess Pieces</title>
      <p>In a standard game of chess, each of the two players begins a game with the following 16
        pieces:</p>

      <title>Initial Setup</title>
      <p>At the beginning of the game, the pieces are arranged, one on a square, as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><p>The 2 rooks are placed on the outside corners, right and left edge.</p></li>
          <li><p>The 2 knights are placed immediately inside of the rooks.</p></li>
          <li><p>The 2 bishops are placed immediately inside of the knights.</p></li>
          <li><p>The queen is placed on the central square of the same color of that of the player
            (white queen on the white square and black queen on the black square).</p></li>
          <li><p>The king takes the vacant spot next to the queen.</p></li>
          <li><p>The 8 pawns are placed one square in front of all of the other pieces.</p></li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="gameplay">
      <title>Gameplay</title>
      <p>The player controlling the light pieces is usually named "White", while the player
        controlling the dark pieces is usually named "Black". White moves first, then players
        alternate moves. Making a move is required. It is not legal to skip a move, even when it is
        detrimental to move. Play continues until a king is <xref href="#Chess/section_check"
          format="dita"><strong>checkmated</strong></xref>, a player forfeits, or a <strong>draw</strong> is
        declared.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="movement">
      <title>Movement</title>
      <p>Each type of chess piece has its own method of movement. A piece moves to a vacant square
        except when capturing an opponent's piece.</p>
      <p>Except for any move of the knight and <xref href="#Chess/section_castling" format="dita"
            ><strong>castling</strong></xref>, pieces cannot jump over other pieces. A piece is
          <i>captured</i> (or <i>taken</i>) when an attacking enemy piece replaces it on its square.
        The captured piece is thereby permanently removed from the game.</p>
      <p>Note: The king can be put <xref href="#Chess/section_check" format="dita"><strong>in
            check</strong></xref> but cannot be captured. </p>

            <dd>
              <ul>
                <li><p>The king can move <b>one</b> space at a time vertically, horizontally or
                  diagonally. The king is not used as an attacking piece (except perhaps at the very
                  end of the game) because, since he is so valuable, you want to keep him protected
                  and out of harm's way. Nonetheless, he is capable of attacking any of the opposing
                  pieces except the king and queen, to which he cannot get close enough to
                  capture.</p></li>
                <li><p>Kings are not offensive pieces. Your king is the piece you most want to protect,
                  because if you lose him, you lose the game.</p></li>

                <li><p>The queen is the most powerful piece on the board. She can be thought of as the
                    <b>rook and bishop combined.</b> The queen can move any number of vacant squares
                    <i>horizontally, vertically or diagonally</i>.</p></li>
                <li><p>Attacking with a queen is the same as with rooks and bishops. That is, she
                  captures an opponent's piece that lies within her path by moving to that piece's
                  square.</p></li>

                <li><p>Bishops may move any number of vacant squares in any <b>diagonal</b> direction.
                  Like rooks, they may capture an opponent's piece within its path by stopping on
                  that piece's square.</p></li>
                <li><p>The bishop proceeds, lands, and captures diagonally and remains throughout the
                  game on the same color squares on which it begins the game. Thus, each player has
                  a white-square bishop and a dark-square bishop.</p></li>
                <li><p>As with rooks, if another of your pieces blocks your bishop's path, the bishop
                  must stop before reaching the occupied square. If the blocking piece belongs to
                  your opponent, you may stop on (but not jump over) that square and capture the
                  occupying piece.</p></li>

                  (in other words, two spaces horizontally and one space vertically or one space

                <li><p>A knight captures a piece only when it lands on that piece's square. In other

      <p><strong>Castling</strong> consists of moving the king two squares towards a rook, then placing

      <p>If a player advances a pawn to its eighth rank, the pawn is then <strong>promoted</strong>
        (converted) to a queen, rook, bishop, or knight of the same color at the choice of the
        player. The choice is not limited to previously captured pieces. Hence, it is theoretically
        possible for a player to have up to nine queens or up to ten rooks, bishops, or knights if

      <title>Check and Checkmate</title>
      <p>A king is <strong>in check</strong> when it is under attack by at least one enemy piece. A
        piece that is unable to move because it would place its own king <strong>in check</strong> may
        still <strong>check</strong> the opposing player.</p>
      <p>It is illegal to make a move that places or leaves one's king in check. The possible ways
